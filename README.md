webtrees-svgtree
================

An alternative tree module for the webtrees program. This is still a work in progress.

Installation
============
Simply extract the contents of this repo into your webtrees modules_v3 directory.

    cd <webtrees root>/modules_v3/
    git clone https://github.com/oddityoverseer13/webtrees-svgtree.git

NOTE: This module uses the SVN version of webtrees atm, so it won't work with most installations. Eventually, it'll use a standard webtrees version (probably 1.5)
